## Summary

For our final project we decided to take a dataset from a Kaggle.com competition on House Prices. The purpose of the competition is to predict the final price of each home. We chose this dataset and competition due to our shared interest in finances and housing prices. The housing market is always a controversial topic with predictions being made everyday of whether housing prices will crash like it did in 2008. Currently, high mortgage prices haunt our home owners which will slow down the housing market. The goal of our project is to predict the housing prices for Ames, Iowa. We seek to answer the following questions: 

* What variables best describe the target variable (sale price)?

Test used: 

* We are thinking of using random forest and gradiant boosting to answer the above question. 

## Tools Used

We will be using: 
 * Jupyter Notebook
 * Python
